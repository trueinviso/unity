# Unity
A Ruby on Rails Engine to quickly add subscription support to your application.
This is a work in progress and will start off supporting Braintree.  I will
also be adding support for Stripe and possibly other payment processors.  In the
future this may also expand to support transactions.

## Usage
How to use my plugin.
